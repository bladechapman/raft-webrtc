The traditional model for consensus-driven applications is to build a network of managed servers that vend a large number of clients. This centralization raises questions of privacy, data ownership, and reliability for the customers of these applications. This project explores the potential of achieving consensus on the end-userâ€™s device as a means of addressing these questions. We do this by providing an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm that can be run in the browser and communicate directly with peers via WebRTC. We then demonstrate this implementation with a simple chat application that uses Raft to achieve consensus on chat history. We find that using peer-to-peer channels for achieving consensus inherently protects the end user better than traditional architectures, but requires demanding guarantees on algorithm throughput and byzantine fault tolerance.
